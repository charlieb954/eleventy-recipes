# ELEVENTY RECIPES

This project is a simple recipe book created using Eleventy and basic CSS to generate a static site for personal cooking. 

It's intentionally simplistic design allows me to quickly upload recipes as markdown files which are generated into HTML files. The recipes are variations of recipes from advert-riddled websites and/or social media videos.

Below is the folder structure explained for future reference.

## docs
The static website generated by Eleventy is stored here, as specified in the .eleeventy.js output field.

## src
This folder includes the layouts such as the base.html file for all webpages to inherit. At the moment, 2 other layouts exist one for home.html, which bullet points all the available receipes, and a second for recipe.html which all the recipes use as a template.

The CSS folder is stored here and is added as a passthrough/watchtargetin the .eleventy.js file.

The folder recipes contains the markdown files for all the recipes which are then transformed into html files by Eleventy.

Finally, this folder includes the index.md file which is the home page of the static website.

## .nojekyll
GitHub pages attempts to use Jekyll to build a static website, this empty file tells GitHub not to use Jekyll.
