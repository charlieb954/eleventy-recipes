## info  
* About 1 hour 30 minutes (including cooling)

## ingredients
- 225g unsalted butter (softened)
- 225g caster sugar
- 4 eggs
- 225g self-raising flour
- Zest of 1.5 lemons

For the drizzle topping
- juice of 1.5 lemons
- 85g caster sugar

## steps  
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C (fan).
2. Cream the softened butter with the caster sugar until light and fluffy, then
   beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
3. Fold in the sifted self-raising flour and the lemon zest until the batter is
   smooth and evenly combined.
4. Line a 4 x 24 cm loaf tin with greaseproof paper, spoon in the batter and
   smooth the top.
5. Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until a thin skewer inserted into the centre comes
   out clean.
6. While the cake cools in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster
   sugar to make the drizzle.
7. Pierce the warm cake all over with a skewer, then pour the drizzle over so
   the juice soaks in and the sugar forms a crisp topping.
8. Leave the loaf to cool completely in the tin before removing. Store in an
   airtight container and eat within 3-4 days.
