## info  
* About 90 minutes  
* 4 servings

## ingredients
- 250g conchiglioni pasta shells
- 300g ricotta
- 1kg fresh spinach (or 300g frozen)
- 2 eggs
- 75g parmesan
- Salt and pepper
- 2 garlic cloves
- Bechamel sauce
- 700g tomato passata

## steps  
1. Fry the spinach without adding any extra liquid. Drain the spinach making sure you have removed as much liquid as possible then, once it has cooled, chop it and mix it in a bowl with the ricotta, the eggs and the parmesan, adding salt and pepper as required. 
2. Put a pan of water on to boil for the pasta. Cook the conchiglioni a little less than the time required, then drain and let the pasta cool. Separate the shells.
3. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan or skillet, add the whole peeled garlic cloves and cook until they start to soften and brown. Add the tomato passata. Let the sauce simmer for 15-20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove the garlic when the sauce is ready.
4. Cover the bottom of an oven dish with some of the tomato sauce and some béchamel. With the help of a teaspoon or small tablespoon, take a little of the filling and fill each conchiglioni, then place it in the oven dish.
5. Add some more béchamel to the top of each pasta shell. Pour the rest of the tomato sauce over the shells and finish with a sprinkling of parmesan, then bake in a preheated oven 180- 200° C for about 20 minutes until the top starts to brown.
