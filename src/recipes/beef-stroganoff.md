## info  
* About 60 minutes  
* 2-3 servings  

## ingredients
- 500g sliced into 2-inch-long strips
- 300g mushrooms, sliced 1/2 inch thick
- 500ml double cream
- 500ml water with 2 beef oxo cubes
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon thyme
- 1 bay leaf

## steps  
1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 
2. Add beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing frequently, until browned on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to bowl.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low and heat the remaining oil and butter in the same skillet. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing often, until mushrooms are golden brown and tender, about 6 minutes.

Return beef to skillet; cook over medium-low heat until sauce is thick and creamy, 8â€“10 minutes. Taste and adjust season with salt and pepper, if necessary. Turn off the heat and whisk in sour cream and mustard; mix until well combined. Serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley.
