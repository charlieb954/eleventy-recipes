## info  
* About 60 minutes  
* 2-3 servings  

## ingredients
- 500g sliced beef into 2-inch-long strips
- 300g mushrooms, sliced
- 500ml double cream
- 500ml water with 2 beef oxo cubes
- 1 onion, sliced
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp butter
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 tsp thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp Worcestershire
- Salt and pepper to taste

## steps  
1. Heat the olive oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 
2. Add the beef, season with salt and pepper and cook, tossing frequently, until browned on all sides - about 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.
3. Reduce the skillet heat to medium-low. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, tossing often, until mushrooms are golden brown and tender, about 6 minutes.
4. Add water, cream, Worcestershire sauce, and bay leaf; mix to combine and bring to a simmer. Cook until reduced, about 6 minutes. Return beef to skillet; cook over medium-low heat until sauce is thick and creamy, 8â€“10 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper as required. Turn off the heat and whisk in the sour cream and mustard; mix until well combined. Serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley.
