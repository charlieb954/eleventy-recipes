<ul>
<li>About 45 minutes</li>
<li>4 servings</li>
</ul>
<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>300g dried macaroni</li>
<li>30g butter</li>
<li>25g flour</li>
<li>500ml milk</li>
<li>1 tsp mustard powder</li>
<li>200g mature cheddar grated</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Dried breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>
<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200C Fan.</li>
<li>Cook the macaroni until it’s a bit less done than normal – a couple of minutes less than you would usually do.</li>
<li>While the macaroni is cooking, make the cheese sauce. Melt the butter in a medium sized pan on a low heat. When the butter is foaming, add the flour and stir until it’s mixed in, then keep cooking for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
<li>Very gradually add the milk, stirring constantly. Make sure each bit of milk is incorporated before adding the next bit. If you do this slowly on a very low heat, you should end up with a perfectly smooth cheese sauce with no lumps and no need to whisk.</li>
<li>When all the milk is incorporated, add the mustard powder, salt and pepper. Then add half the cheese, stir to combine and turn off.</li>
<li>When the pasta is done, drain it, retaining a little bit of the cooking water.</li>
<li>Tip the pasta and a couple of tablespoonfuls of the cooking water into the cheese sauce and stir.</li>
<li>Pour the macaroni cheese into a shallow ovenproof dish and sprinkle over the remaining cheese and dried breadcrumbs.</li>
<li>Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes. The top should be brown but the bottom should still be saucy and the macaroni should be perfectly cooked.</li>
</ol>
